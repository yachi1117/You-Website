          <p>
          I teach a range of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, focusing on the intersections of migration, globalization, borders, and sociological methods. My teaching philosophy centers on empowering students to develop a keen sociological perspective, fostering their ability to critically analyze complex social phenomena. I strive to provide my students with the tools necessary for academic excellence and to inspire them to become actively engaged and informed citizens. Through a blend of theoretical frameworks and practical applications, my courses aim to cultivate a deep understanding of the sociopolitical dynamics shaping our world.
